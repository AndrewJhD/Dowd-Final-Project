# Dowd-Final-Project
My Final Project for my data structures class 

It was a record making program to document employees assigned and completed work that could show each employees stats and data
It has a simple gui that allows you to input both employees and the work they completed along with how difficult the work was. It also allowed you to remove employee records if needed as well and get a summary of all employees and their completed work.
